# Hello!
### My name is Jaiden *(but I usually go by guiguig online!)*
I am a programmer and game dev primarily, but I also do things like music and occasionaly electrical engineering.

Here you an find many of my projects, all open source and most have the MIT License. If you have an issue with any of them, feel free to make an Issue <img src="assets/github-issue.svg" width=12> on that repository!
